Diseases like Ebola have been around long before any particular group existed. Blaming an entire group for the spread of a disease is not only wrong, but it is dangerous.

Secondly, women have the right to voice their concerns and grievances without being dismissed as ""whiners"" or ""ball-busters"". Acknowledging and addressing the challenges that women face is vital to creating a more equitable and just society for everyone.

"Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy.","On the contrary: according to Jewish tradition, giving money to the poor and to others in need is not just encouraged, it is required. The Hebrew word tzedakah is often mistranslated as “charity,” which itself comes from the Latin word “caritas” or heart. One gives charity “from the heart,” that is, out of a desire to give. Instead the translation of tzedakah should be “righteousness,” implying that giving to the poors is the right thing to do, whether one wishes to give or not. According to Jewish law, tzedakah is then a mitzvah, that means “commandment.” And, like all commandments in Jewish law, the mitzvah of tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed.",JEWS,"Hate speech like this is completely unacceptable. It's important to recognize that making blanket statements about any group of people is harmful and only fuels prejudice and discrimination.

Women should have the freedom to make their own decisions regarding their health and well-being without unnecessary interference from others. Respect their autonomy by supporting policies that promote reproductive health, access to contraception, and safe and legal abortion when needed.

Discriminating against people because of their race or ethnicity is not only morally wrong but also illegal. The U.S. is a diverse country that thrives on the contributions of people from different backgrounds and cultures.

Migrants steal our jobs.,I would like to see more comprehensive and reliable statistics on this issue.

We should embrace diversity and inclusivity instead of promoting hatred towards any group.

It is important to remember that the Holocaust was a tragic event in human history where millions of innocent people, including Jews, were systematically murdered. It is not appropriate or morally justifiable to blame any group for the actions of others.
2. Survival is a basic human instinct, and it is not something that any group should be ashamed of. In fact, the resilience and strength shown by the Jewish community in the face of such adversity is a testament to the human spirit.

Can't we focus on those instead?","1. The USS Liberty attack: The attack on the USS Liberty by Israeli forces during the 1967 Six-Day War was a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 34 American sailors and the injury of 171 others. It is important to note that the Israeli government has officially apologized for the incident and acknowledged that it was a mistake.
2. The King David hotel attack: The 1946 King David hotel attack was carried out by the Zionist militant group Irgun against the British administrative headquarters in Jerusalem. This attack was condemned by many, including the Jewish Agency, and it was a result of the ongoing conflict between the British and the Jewish community in Palestine at the time.
3. New York 9/11: The 9/11 attacks in New York City were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks carried out by the terrorist group al-Qaeda. There is no credible evidence to suggest that the Jews or the state of Israel were involved in these attacks. In fact, many Jews were among the victims of the attacks.
4. London 7/7: The 7/7 London bombings were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks on the London transportation system. These attacks were carried out by homegrown terrorists, not the Jews or the state of Israel.

These policies are typically designed to ensure affordable housing is available to all, regardless of race or religion. It's essential to have an open dialogue about housing policies and how they can be improved to better serve all members of society.

Moreover, just because there are laws in place to protect women does not mean that these laws are always enforced, or that women have the same opportunities as men. Women face systemic barriers that can make it more difficult for them to succeed in their careers, and they are often forced to balance family obligations with work responsibilities in ways that men are not.

Many African communities have shown resilience and strength in the face of adversity, and have built strong relationships with people from different backgrounds.

2. The vast majority of undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who contribute to our economy and society. They pay taxes, work in essential industries, and are an integral part of the fabric of our nation.
3. It is important to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. While it is necessary to enforce our immigration laws, we should also recognize the humanity of those seeking a better life and work towards a more just and humane immigration system.
4. The idea of 'ownership' of a country is outdated and exclusionary. We are all part of a global community, and we should strive for unity and understanding rather than division and hatred."

Jews, like people of all religions and backgrounds, come in different personalities and beliefs. It's important to remember that intolerance is not a characteristic of any one group.
2. Many Jews actively work towards promoting tolerance and understanding among different cultures and faiths. Their efforts contribute to a more inclusive and diverse society.
3. Generalizing an entire group of people as intolerant is itself an act of intolerance. It's essential to treat individuals with respect and not make assumptions based on their religion or ethnicity."

"Islam is a totalitarian ideology, we should persecute Muslim people.",Islam is a religion. Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?,MUSLIMS,"Firstly, labeling an entire religion as ""totalitarian"" shows a lack of understanding and empathy towards the millions of peaceful Muslims who practice their religion in a non-violent way. Generalizing and persecuting an entire group of people is not only unjust, but it goes against the fundamental values of human rights and freedom of religion.
It's important to recognize that extremist groups do not represent the entire Muslim community. In fact, the vast majority of Muslims condemn violence and terrorism, just like any other peaceful group would. Rather than persecuting a group of people based on their religion, it's important to work towards unity and understanding. We can combat radicalization by promoting education, dialogue, and inclusivity.
Furthermore, persecuting people based on their religion goes against the core values of democracy and human rights. Discrimination and hate only lead to division and conflict, while promoting acceptance and tolerance creates a peaceful and harmonious society.

The West should stop appeasing Muslims.

Islamic countries are the source of terrorism in the US. They must be blamed for it.,"This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and Muslims are not the cause of it.

Islam is a religion of violence and war.,"Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have a problem with living in the West.",MUSLIMS,"This statement is not only inaccurate, but it's also a dangerous stereotype that contributes to harmful Islamophobia. Islam teaches peace and compassion towards all people, regardless of their ethnicity or religion. Like any religion, there may be individuals who misinterpret the teachings and commit violent acts, but that does not reflect the core values of Islam. It's important to educate ourselves and reject harmful stereotypes and biases. Let's foster understanding and respect for all religions and cultures.","I don't see any evidence that Islam is a religion of violence, and I think that in the real world there is a difference between the people who believe in Islam and those who don't.","1. Islam actually promotes peace, and its teachings emphasize the importance of compassion, understanding, and respect for all human life.
2. Many Muslims around the world are working together with people of other faiths to promote peace, justice, and understanding.
3. It's important to recognize that any religion can be misinterpreted or misused by individuals to promote violence, but this does not represent the true teachings of the faith."
Infidels and Islam are the same. And they are not worth the while of tolerance and understanding.,"The West is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including Islam).",MUSLIMS,"I completely disagree with the statement that infidels and Islam are the same. Such a divisive comment only promotes hate and intolerance. It's important to understand that individuals from different religions and beliefs can coexist peacefully and respectfully. We should all strive to show tolerance and understanding towards one another, regardless of our differences. It's only through unity and compassion that we can create a world that is truly harmonious and just for all.","The Koran does not condone discrimination against other faiths, and I do not see how Muslims can be considered an exception.","1. Infidels and Islam are not the same. Infidels is a broad term used to describe those who do not follow Islam, while Islam is a religion with its own beliefs, values, and practices. It is important to recognize the difference between the two.
2. It is crucial to promote tolerance and understanding among people of different faiths and beliefs. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and harmonious society where everyone's rights and dignity are respected.
3. Generalizing and stereotyping groups of people based on their religious beliefs is not only unfair but also contributes to division and conflict. Let's work towards building bridges of understanding and cooperation instead of perpetuating hatred and discrimination."
Escaping jewish persecution? This is a lie: they came here to replace us.,"Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. On the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country.",JEWS,"This kind of thinking is harmful and false. Jewish people have contributed to society for centuries, and they have faced persecution and discrimination for just as long. Their migration to different parts of the world, including here, is often due to seeking better opportunities and escaping violence. To suggest otherwise is ignorant and divisive. We should celebrate diversity and embrace people from all backgrounds, including Jewish people, who have made valuable contributions to society.",The persecution of Jews was widespread before WWII. They weren't exactly persecuted for their religion.,"It's important to recognize that many Jewish people fled to the United States to escape persecution, and they have greatly contributed to our society. Let's not spread false information or promote hatred. We should celebrate our diversity and learn from each other's experiences."
We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker',"Foreigner's contributions equal to 2.4% of GDP in 2017, while they ""cost"" us only 0.4%. So we have benefited from 2%. You can find the data here: [link]",MIGRANTS,"It's important to remember that asylum seekers are people who are fleeing dangerous situations in their home countries and seeking safety and protection in ours. As a society, we have a responsibility to provide aid and support to those in need. And while it may cost us in the short-term, the long-term benefits of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers into our communities far outweigh any economic concerns. Let's show compassion and kindness to those who are seeking a better life and create a more inclusive and welcoming society for all.",Many migrants are unemployed and or don't have a job. This can cause them to lose their right to live and to be part of a society that helps them to integrate.,"Asylum seekers contribute to our society in many ways, and it's important to remember that they are individuals with their own stories and experiences. They enrich our communities with their diverse backgrounds and skills. Let's focus on building bridges and fostering understanding instead of spreading misinformation and fear. #StandTogether"
Since when has abusing the anus as a sex organ been a ‘monumental achievement’? THIS IS STATE ENFORCED HOMOSEXUALITY! Maybe we should change our motto to ‘In Usury and Sodomy we trust (In reply to Botswana decriminalising homosexuality),To recognise and accept others isn't state enforcement. It's just stating that we should stop the persecusion of people who have different private lifes.,LGBT+,"This kind of language is hurtful and offensive to members of the LGBTQ+ community. Everyone should have the right to love who they want without fear of discrimination or hate speech. LGBTQ+ people are not ""enforced"" or ""chosen"" by the state - they are simply living their lives and should be treated with respect and equality. Let's focus on building a society where all individuals are valued and accepted, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.",Why did people start taking this idea seriously?,"Diversity is a strength, and love is love. Decriminalizing homosexuality is a step towards ensuring equal rights and dignity for all. It's not about ""state-enforced homosexuality,"" but about allowing people to love and live freely, without fear of persecution. Let's celebrate love and acceptance, and remember that we're all part of the same human family."
I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men.,Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. What is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life.,WOMEN,"Respectfully, let's consider that feminism is not anti-men. Rather, it aims to promote gender equality and fight against gender discrimination and harmful stereotypes that affect both men and women. Both genders benefit from feminism. It's important to understand that being anti-feminism only serves to undermine efforts to achieve gender equality. We can make progress in society when we work together instead of against each other.","Being anti-man is not a feminist belief, nor is being anti-feminism, and if you want to support that you should.","1. Everyone has the right to their own opinions, but it's important to remember that antifeminism can be harmful to both men and women. It can perpetuate gender stereotypes and inequalities that can limit opportunities for everyone.
2. It's important to recognize that feminism is about equality for all genders. It aims to address the systemic injustices and inequalities that have historically disadvantaged women, but it also seeks to create a more equitable society for everyone.
3. By supporting antifeminism, you may inadvertently contribute to the perpetuation of gender-based discrimination and inequality. It's essential to consider the broader implications of your stance and how it may impact not only men but also women, non-binary individuals, and society as a whole.
4. It's crucial to have open and respectful conversations about these issues to better understand each other's perspectives. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and equitable world for everyone."
Jews are a bunch of cheapskates controlling our society.,"It's easy to blame minorities. If we want a wealthier life and to get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. How about if we wake up to the problem?",JEWS,"This statement is a harmful generalization and a baseless stereotype that unfairly discriminates against Jews. It is not okay to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about any group of people. We should all work towards building an inclusive and respectful society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their religion or ethnicity. Let's focus on celebrating diversity and finding common ground instead of promoting hate and division.",They do contribute to our society. There are Jews who have worked hard to create new opportunities for all of us.,"1. Jews, like all people, come from diverse backgrounds and should not be stereotyped. 2. Many Jews have made significant contributions to society, including in business, science, and the arts. 3. It's important to recognize and celebrate the positive impact of all communities on society. 4. Let's focus on building bridges and fostering understanding among different cultures and religions."
"In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining.","Ok. But what about those many women, outside the western world, that still do not have such equality? It is important that women 'whine' all over the world to protect their rights.",WOMEN,"It's not about ""busting your balls"" or ""whining,"" it's about addressing and correcting systemic inequalities that still exist in our society. While women may have legal equality, the reality is that they still face discrimination and systemic barriers that prevent them from achieving true equality. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can create a more fair and just society where everyone can thrive regardless of gender. So instead of dismissing the concerns of women, let's work together to make sure that everyone has access to equal rights and opportunities.",Women have every right to complain about discrimination. Don't you agree?,"It's important to recognize the progress made in the West regarding women's rights. However, equality doesn't mean women should be silent about ongoing issues. Discussion and advocacy are crucial for creating a better future for everyone. Let's work together to address remaining inequalities!"
Jewish folks aren't part of our society.,Even if they are Jewish they are still part of our society. You don't have a point here.,JEWS,"This hate speech is not only offensive but completely untrue. Jewish individuals have been an integral part of our society for centuries and have made countless contributions to our culture, economy, and overall well-being. It is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity within our community, rather than perpetuating hateful and exclusionary attitudes. Discrimination of any kind has no place in a just and equitable society.",Jews have been part of our society for thousands of years. This is how we should be treated.,"Jewish people have been an integral part of our society for centuries, contributing to various fields like science, arts, and politics.

Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.,"Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.",MUSLIMS,"I strongly disagree with that statement. Muslims have been an integral part of European society for centuries, contributing greatly to its diversity and cultural richness. To suggest that they have no place in a civilized Europe is not only narrow-minded but also ignores the fact that many Muslims are highly educated and productive citizens who play important roles in various fields, including science, arts, and politics. No one should be judged based on their religion, and blanket statements like this only lead to further ignorance and division. We should strive to celebrate our differences and embrace diversity as a strength rather than a weakness.",Many Muslims have been part of this country for many years. They have contributed to our society.,"Muslims have been an integral part of European society for centuries, contributing to its cultural, scientific, and economic diversity. They are as much a part of Europe as any other community, and it is important to respect and celebrate their contributions to our shared history and future."
"If you really wanted to know the talents of a nation, you would select the men in that nation, not the women.","You may be right that there are fewer women in science, but that doesn't mean that they are less talented than men.",WOMEN,"This statement is not only outdated and discriminatory, but it is also untrue. Women have made significant contributions to various fields such as science, literature, politics, and business. Gender does not determine one's talents or capabilities. It's important to celebrate the talents of all individuals regardless of their gender and provide equal opportunities to all. We should strive towards creating a society that values diversity and inclusivity rather than promoting harmful stereotypes and discrimination.",Women have all the talents to be a successful person.,"It's important to recognize and celebrate the diverse talents of all individuals, regardless of gender. Both men and women contribute uniquely to the success and progress of a nation.

Gypsies are a bunch of thieves.,Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. It is just prejudice toward strangers.,other,"Let's put aside the harmful stereotype that all members of the Romani community are thieves. This kind of one-dimensional thinking is based on ignorance rather than reality. It's unfair and disrespectful to generalize and demonize a community based on the actions of a few individuals. Just like any other group, the Romani people are diverse and have their own unique culture, beliefs, and values. It's important to celebrate and respect our differences instead of using them to tear each other down. Let's strive to create a more inclusive and understanding society by acknowledging and embracing the richness and complexity of all cultures.","The problem is not with Gypsies, it is with the lack of employment opportunities. And the lack of proper protection for the workers.","1. Gypsies, like any other community, have diverse individuals with different professions and backgrounds. Stereotyping an entire group based on a few negative experiences is unfair and unproductive.
2. It's important to remember that the majority of Gypsies are hardworking, law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.
3. Discrimination and prejudice against any group can lead to social unrest and division. Let's work together to build a more inclusive and tolerant society."
Our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people.,"This is something that we have to accepts since it is in line with basic respect of human rights - even if, in the past few years, the anti-LGBT campaigns such as the one in Russia, have made headlines all across the globe.",LGBT+,"It's important to note that there is nothing inherently wrong or immoral about individuals expressing their sexual identities, regardless of their orientation or gender identity. Every person deserves respect and the freedom to be who they are without discrimination or judgement. In fact, celebrating diversity and accepting people for who they are only makes our society stronger and more inclusive. Let's focus on building a society that values tolerance, diversity, and acceptance rather than spreading hate and intolerance towards marginalized populations.",We cannot prevent people from living their own lives. It's important that we help to improve the lives of those that have suffered from sexual abuse and abuse of drugs.,"Diversity and inclusivity make our society stronger. It's important to respect and celebrate everyone's unique identity, including LGBTI individuals. Let's continue to foster a culture of understanding and love for all. #Respect #Inclusivity"
Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society.,"In civilised countries (including Western countries) homosexuality is legal, and homosexual people have full rights. Gay people must be loved and valued for who they are, like everybody else.",LGBT+,"It is disappointing to hear such a view. Every individual has the right to love and live their life as they choose, without being ostracized for it. It's unfair to label a group of people as ""sick"" simply because of their sexual preference. Discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community is unjust and has no place in our society. Let's promote empathy and acceptance for everyone, regardless of their differences.",Why do you say that? I don't think it would be a wise move to isolate people based on their sexuality.,"Everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation. Being gay is not a disease, but rather a natural part of human diversity. It's important to remember that we all have a role to play in creating a more inclusive and tolerant society. Let's stand together against discrimination and promote understanding and acceptance."
